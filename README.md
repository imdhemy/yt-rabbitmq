Rabbit MQ for PHP developers

## Lessons

**1. Hello World**

In this lesson we set up our local RabbitMQ and implement the traditional Hello World Example. You can find the source
code on the "[01-hello-world](https://github.com/imdhemy/yt-rabbitmq/tree/01-hello-world)" branch.

**2. Work Queues**

In this one we'll create a Work Queue that will be used to distribute time-consuming tasks among multiple workers. You
can find the source code on the "[02-work-queues](https://github.com/imdhemy/yt-rabbitmq/tree/02-work-queues)" branch.
